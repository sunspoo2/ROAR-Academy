# Understanding the Perceptron Equation

# The equation for a perceptron is:
# z = w1 * x1 + w2 * x2 + ... + wn * xn + w0

# Here's what each part of the equation means:

# x1, x2, ..., xn: These are the input features. For example, if you're trying to classify whether an email is spam,
# the inputs could be features like the number of words, the presence of certain keywords, etc.

# w1, w2, ..., wn: These are the weights associated with each input feature. The weights determine how important
# each input feature is to the final decision. Larger weights mean the feature has a bigger impact on the decision.

# w0: This is the bias term. It helps adjust the output along with the weighted sum of the inputs, providing a way
# to shift the decision boundary.

# z: This is the linear combination of the inputs and weights, plus the bias. It represents the weighted sum of all
# the inputs plus the bias.

# Simple Explanation of the Perceptron

# Imagine you are trying to decide if you should go outside based on the temperature and whether it is raining.
# Here's how you can think of the perceptron:

# Inputs (x1, x2):
# x1: The temperature.
# x2: Whether it is raining (1 for yes, 0 for no).

# Weights (w1, w2):
# w1: How important the temperature is in your decision.
# w2: How important it is whether it is raining.

# Bias (w0):
# w0: This can be thought of as your baseline tendency to go outside or not. Maybe you generally like going outside,
# so you might have a positive bias.

# Decision Function:
# You multiply each input by its corresponding weight, sum them up, and then add the bias. This gives you z.

# z = w1 * temperature + w2 * is_raining + w0

# Activation Function:
# Finally, you pass z through an activation function (like a step function or sigmoid function) to get the final decision
# (e.g., go outside or not).

# Decision Boundary Example

# Let's go back to your example where the decision boundary crosses the x1-axis at -2 and the x2-axis at 3. This means:

# When x2 = 0, x1 = -2.
# When x1 = 0, x2 = 3.

# The decision boundary can be written as:
# w1 * x1 + w2 * x2 + w0 = 0

# Using the points:
# At (-2, 0): -2w1 + w0 = 0 gives w0 = 2w1.
# At (0, 3): 3w2 + w0 = 0 gives w0 = -3w2.

# By solving these, we get:
# 2w1 = -3w2

# Choosing w1 = -3 and w2 = 2, we get:
# w0 = 2w1 = 2(-3) = -6.

# In summary, the perceptron calculates a weighted sum of inputs and determines if this sum is above or below
# a certain threshold (decided by the bias). This is used to classify the inputs into different categories.
